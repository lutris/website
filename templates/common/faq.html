        <h3 id='sell-games'>Does Lutris sell games?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        No, we don't sell commercial games on the platform, Lutris allows you
        to install and play games purchased on a variety of different game stores such as
        Steam, Humble Bundle, GOG, Battle.net etc.

      </a>
      <p>
        If you want to ask questions about Lutris or just hang out with other
        Lutris users, you can join the
        <a href="{{ DISCORD_URL }}">Lutris Discord server</a>
        or our IRC channel
        <a href="irc://irc.freenode.org:6667/lutris">#lutris on freenode.org</a>.

      <a class="title" href="#gnome">
        <h3 id="gnome">Is the Gnome desktop a dependency of Lutris?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        No, not at all. The confusion comes from a library we ship
        unfortunately named gnome-desktop, which is not the whole Gnome desktop
        but a collection of utilities that are frequently used within the Gnome
        desktop. This library is used by the Lutris client to support
        resolution switching on Wayland.  This library itself is small and has
        few dependencies.<br/>
        You can install and use Lutris on any desktop environment. Installing
        the client won't install other Gnome components.
      </p>

      <a class="title" href="#ssl-issue">
        <h3 id="ssl-issue">Runners and other lutris provided files fail to download</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        There seems to be some issues with CloudFlare and some ISPs (notably in
        Turkey) when using older versions of libssl.<br>
        <br>
        A quick workaround so is to run lutris with <code>env LC_ALL=C
          lutris</code> but a more reliable solution is to update your version of libssl.
        The following repositories provide libssl 1.1.1.<br>
        On Ubuntu 18.04 based systems:<br>
        <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mgrocock/openssl</code><br>
        On Ubuntu 16.04 based systems:<br>
        <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:carsten-uppenbrink-net/openssl</code>
      </p>

      <a class="title" href="#game-dev">
        <h3 id="game-dev">I'm a game developer, can I publish my game on Lutris?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        You can create a page for your game and submit an installer for it but
        as of now there aren't any special features for game developers. We do
        have some plans to add a game developer role to the website, you can
        follow its development <a href='https://github.com/lutris/website/issues/83'>on Github</a>.
      </p>
      <a class="title" href="#runtime">
        <h3 id="runtime">What is the Lutris runtime?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        The Lutris runtime is a collection of libraries we automatically
        provide to ensure compatibility with all games and runners over all
        Linux distributions. The runtime itself is composed of parts of the
        <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime">Steam runtime</a>,
        some Ubuntu 16.04 libraries and a few extra libraries
        from various places.
      </p>
        <p>
          Of course, ensuring binary compatibility over all existing Linux
          distributions is not an easy task and sometimes issues will arise. If
          such a thing happens, try disabling the runtime in the system options of
          your game. For more details on the runtime, see the <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Lutris-Runtime">wiki</a>.
        </p>
      <a class="title" href="#game-crash">
        <h3 id="game-crash">Game [x] crashes, what should I do?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        First run Lutris from a command line to see potential errors from the game.
        If you see errors related to Linux libraries, try running the game with
        the <a href='#runtime'>runtime</a> disabled. If disabling the
        runtime fixes the issue, please, notify the developers, we don't want
        to ship a broken runtime and your input can help in fixing it.
      </p>
        <p>
          If your game still doesn't launch try collecting as much info about
          your setup (name of the game, your graphics drivers, Linux distribution,
          hardware setup, desktop environment, etc.) and explain your issue to the
          <a href="#community">community</a>.
        </p>
          <p>
            If you want to troubleshoot the issue yourself, there are some good
            resources you can look into. Start by looking up the game on
            <a href="https://pcgamingwiki.com">PCGamingWiki</a>. You might run
            into a known problem and they might have a workaround.
          </p>
            <p>
               If you are trying to run a Windows game, also check out
              <a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/">WineHQ's AppDB</a> or look for
              issues other Windows users are running into, in the Steam forums for
              example.

      <a class="title" href="#url-handler">
        <h3 id="url-handler">Clicking "Install" on the website's games doesn't do anything.</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        Some distributions do not configure URL handlers
        correctly, this is not an issue with Lutris, the same thing will happen
        with, for example, the Steam client.
      </p>
        <p>
          To fix this issue, you can set <code>network.protocol-handler.expose-all</code> to
          <strong>False</strong> in Firefox's about:config. With that flag disabled, you will now
          see a pop-up when clicking "Install", prompting you to choose a program
          to open the URL with. It is recommended you use <code>/usr/bin/xdg-open</code> to
          handle lutris: <br> (or steam:) urls.

      <h2>Runners</h2>
      <a class="title" href="#runner">
        <h3 id="runner">What is a "Runner"?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        A "runner" is the term we use to refer to programs that can run games,
        it can be Linux itself, Wine, DOSBox, MAME, gzdoom, â€¦
        Runners are recognized as such in Lutris itself, not all programs that
        run games are considered runners. For example Darkplaces, the open
        source engine for Quake, is not a runner but gzdoom is. Usually,
        programs become runners if they can run a variety of games, not just
        one or two.

      <h2>Wine games</h2>
      <a class="title" href="#wine-systemwide">
        <h3 id="wine-systemwide">Wine is broken / I have dependency issues.</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        While Lutris can use a wide selection of Wine builds that we provide
        ourselves, it is strongly encouraged to have Wine installed from your
        operating system's package manager. This ensures that all required Wine
        dependencies are present on the system and will produce better results
        when using Lutris builds.
      </p>
      <a class="title" href="#wine-patches">
        <h3 id="wine-patches">Some game requires a custom patch to work properly.</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        Lutris provides custom builds of wine to increase the number of playable games.
        If there are patches out there that makes some game playable and we do
        not distribute them, you can ask us to build it.
      </p>
        <p>
          In order to build a patched version of Wine, we currently need a git
          repository containing the fully patched source tree of Wine. If your
          patches rely on Wine Staging, make sure to apply those as well.
          Once you have patched Wine you can push it to a git repository of your
          choice and notify the moderation team so we can publish the build.
        </p>
      <a class="title" href="#wine-versions">
        <h3 id="wine-versions">How do I change the Wine version used in a game?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        If you already have a version of Wine installed, you should see a Wine
        entry on the sidebar, you can right click on it then select "Manage
        versions". From there you can install or remove any Wine build we
        provide. The wine versions are downloaded to <code>~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/</code>
      </p>
      <a class="title" href="#wine-res">
        <h3 id="wine-res">The resolution is messed up how can I fix that?</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        Resolution switching for Wine games heavily depends on your hardware
        and your desktop environment as well as the game itself.
      </p>
        <p>
          If you are experiencing issues, try using a virtual desktop in the Wine
          runner options then start the game and set it to use your monitor's
          native resolution. Once the game is using your native resolution, you
          should be able to turn off the virtual desktop.
        </p>
      <a class="title" href="#winemenubuilder">
        <h3 id="winemenubuilder">I get winemenubuilder.exe errors in the console output</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        You shouldn't worry about those. We explicitly disable winemenubuilder
        at runtime so it doesn't mess with your Linux desktop's file type
        associations. Any error related to winemenubuilder can be safely
        ignored.
      </p>
