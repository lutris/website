        Lutris is an open source gaming platform for GNU/Linux. It allows you
        to gather and manage (install, configure and launch) all your games
        acquired from any source, in a single interface.

    <h2>Using Lutris</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        Like Steam, Lutris has two parts: a website and a client application,
        which communicate. On the website, you can browse the supported games,
        add them to your personal library and start their installation by
        clicking on the Install link for the version of the game you possess
        (if someone bothered to make an installer for it ;). Granted that you
        have installed the client software, it will open the game installation
        window, leading you through the steps to finalize the game's setup.
        Once it's done, you will be able to launch the game directly or close
        the installation window and the game will be present in your local
        library the next time you start Lutris.
      </p>
      <p>
        But first you will surely want to use our automated import tool to add
        your existing game libraries. For now we only have import for Steam but
        in the future Lutris should be able to import your GOG library, your
        installed ScummVM games, your game roms and maybe scan your system for
        other installed games. Oh and PlayOnLinux import, we should have it at
        some point too.
      </p>
      <p>
        To <strong>import your Steam library</strong>, go to your Lutris
        profile and click the "Sign in through Steam" button. You will then be
        redirected to Steam and will be asked to login. This steps associates
        your Steam accout with your Lutris account. This procedure does not
        grant Lutris any rights on your Steam account, the only info we get
        from this is your Steam account identifier. Your Steam account has to
        be public in order for the library sync to work, if you like it
        private, you can make it public before the import and switch it back
        when completed.<br/>
        You can then start Lutris, connect it to your web account from the menu
        Lutris → Connect, and all your Steam games will be  added. Your
        games installed in Steam will also show up as installed in Lutris
        (Linux Steam only). Please note that not all of your Steam games
        will be playable out of the box: a lot of Windows games don't have
        installers yet and some of them won't even start with Wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also have the ability to <strong>manually add games</strong> to the
        client, from the Game → Add menu or from the toolbar button. The Add
        Game window will let you enter the game's name, pick the runner<sup>
        <a href='#about-runners'>[1]</a></sup> (more runners can be installed
        from the runners management window, available from the Lutris menu →
        Manage runners), browse for the main executable/rom and enter other
        necessary details before saving.
      </p>
      <p class='footnote' id='about-runners'><sup>[1]</sup> Runners are the
      various pieces of software (Wine, emulators, Steam for Linux and Windows...)
      that we use to launch games. By extension, Linux is also a runner.
      </p>

    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        Lutris should work on any modern Linux platform, the client tries to
        minimize its dependencies and avoid relying on the system package manager
        whenever it can. This allows to keep a predictable behavior between
        different flavors of Linux.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lutris is currently officially supported on current versions of Debian
        Testing, Ubuntu LTS, Fedora, Gentoo, Arch Linux, Mageia and OpenSuse.
        Maintainers for all other distributions are more than welcome.

    <h2>Contributing to the project</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        There are many ways to contribute to Lutris. The simplest way is to
        submit games to the website's database (you'll see the "Submit a new
        game" button on the <a href="/games">games list</a>) and writing
        installers (look for the small link below the existing installers on
        each game's page).<br/>
        If you have some Python and PyGObject knowledge, you can grab the
        source from git with:
        <pre>git clone https://github.com/lutris/lutris</pre><br/>
        If you know your way around Django, you can also help with the website:
        <a href="https://github.com/lutris/website">github.com/lutris/website</a>.<br/>
        If you want to get your hands real dirty and get into some C/C++ code,
        we also maintain the emulators shipped with Lutris, you can help by
        sending patches for better fullscreen or controller support or anything
        you can think of that would make these emulators better. You can get
        most of them at <a href="https://github.com/lutris">github.com/lutris</a>.
