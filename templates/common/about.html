      <p>
        Lutris is an open gaming platform for Linux. Lutris helps you install and play video games from all eras and from most gaming systems. By leveraging and combining existing emulators, engine re-implementations and compatibility layers, it gives you a central interface to launch all your games.

The client can connect with existing services like Humble Bundle, GOG and Steam to make your game libraries easily available. Game downloads and installations are automated and can be modified through user made scripts.
        Before installing Lutris (or at least before running any games), make sure your computer is fully setup to run games.
        This includes making sure your graphics drivers are installed and up to date, that Vulkan is installed and that the 32bit
        libraries for OpenGL / Vulkan are present. If any of those components are missing Lutris will give a warning.
        We also very highly recommend installing Wine from your package manager. This can be any version of Wine
        (stable, development or staging) as long as it pulls both 32bit and 64bit variants. Lutris will usually not make
        use of it directly but the peer dependencies installed from the Wine package are necessary to run our Wine version properly.

      <p>
        Use the Sources section on the sidebar to login to games stores or
        to your Lutris account. Once logged in, your game library will
        appear in the appropriate section. The Steam service doesn't require
        you to login but requires Steam to be installed on your system and for
        your account to be public (at least for the duration of the sync).

        Runners are the programs Lutris use to run games. We provide those programs so there is no
        need to have them installed on your system (except Wine, as mentioned earlier).<br>
        Runners can be compatibility layers, emulators or game engine capable of running games from
        various hardware and software platforms.

        game files can be kept for future installations.
